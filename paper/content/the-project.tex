Design process.

How the project works.

- Administration scheme:
    - Services
        - Data
            - Knowledge tree
                - The tree is built in server not in client
        - External
            - Map with key-value being the key the name of the external service and the value a function which runs the service

- Searching the tree
    - scoring the tree with one pass
    - problem: when we have the query found in the parent and child. Eg: tainara -> tainara@gmail.com
