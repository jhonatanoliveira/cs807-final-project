Accessibility is a key assistive accommodation to enable people  overcome physical, technological, or informational barriers \cite{acessguide13}.


A \emph{terminal information systems} is a computation system which [blank].
As a computation system, a terminal information systems is has specific constrains associated with its components.
For instance, power constrains applies since the terminal usually is implemented in low power devices.
In this report we present the proposal and implementation of a low cost terminal information systems with voice recognition feature.

In our project we sought for tools to enhance the experience and quality on a terminal information systems. 
The first tool we chose was Wit.ai, [blank].
Wit.ai is good [blank].

As foe an efficient system to manage the data and improve the information retrieval, the implementation was executed with meteor.js, [blank]
Meteor is goof [blank].

The cost of the project is manly dictated by the hardware component that holds the system.
Some platforms usually utilized for low cost system are [blank].
In our project the hardware chosen was Reaspberry.py, [blank].
Rep is goof [blank.]

With the implementation some issues were faced.
For instance, one of our first goal of the project was to provide a map localization and direction to the user.
This feature is commonly seen in big centers such malls, hospitals or airports.
Althouhgt some systems are availabe, such as [blank]. we realized they are not at level for small systens, and when they are, not simply. This constarins are better descripted in Section [Blanck]
We then turn our attentions for the soctware design and search engine of the termnal.
We developted a semantic seach that permforms efficienty search on a tree structure.
Well know algorith as breadth-fisrts and deapth serach was utilizled for this task.

The project presents many salient feature.
Firts, it cn be voice activated and has state-of-the art speech recognition trhoeght the usage of the wit.ai.
Second, it performs an efficienty seach on the tree strcytue implemented on metero. 
Fetures as uncertanty decision,imcplemete infromation are well handled by the sustem.
Thir, The implementations was condutc on a a reps.py, which is wel suited for the project since it is (i) [blank] and (ii) [blank].
This report is organized as follows.
