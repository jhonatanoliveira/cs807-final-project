The initial plan for our final project included a service inside the app for indoor navigation.
The idea was to allow the user to ask for a location within the University of Regina main campus and the app would trace a route from where the device hosting the app is to where the user requested.
Indoor navigation itself is a complex and well known task problem in computer science and engineering.
Our primary focus was to use some already available solution for indoor navigation, instead of trying to come up with our own solution.
In this way, we wanted to show how resource constrain devices can still be used to provide such service by using cloud computing.

We did a broad research on publicly available solutions for indoor navigation, including paid, free or open source ones.
